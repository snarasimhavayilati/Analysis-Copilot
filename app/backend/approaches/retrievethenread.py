    'What are the regulatory requirements for maintaining capital adequacy ratios for mid-sized banks?'

    Sources:
    info1.txt: Mid-sized banks (assets between $10 billion and $250 billion) must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5%.
    info2.pdf: The Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for mid-sized banks is 6%.
    info3.pdf: Total capital ratio for all banks should be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets.
    info4.pdf: Mid-sized banks are subject to annual stress tests to ensure they can maintain capital ratios under adverse economic conditions.
    """

    answer = """Based on the provided sources, mid-sized banks have several regulatory requirements for capital adequacy:

    1. They must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5% [info1.txt].
    2. The Tier 1 capital ratio requirement is 6% [info2.pdf].
    3. The total capital ratio should be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets [info3.pdf].
    4. These banks are subject to annual stress tests to ensure they can maintain capital ratios under adverse economic conditions [info4.pdf].

    It's important to note that these requirements help ensure the financial stability and resilience of mid-sized banks. Regular monitoring and reporting of these ratios are crucial for maintaining compliance with regulatory standards."""
